# Top-K High Utility Itemset Mining

<p>
  High utility itemsets are sets of items having a high utility or profit in a
  database. Efficiently discovering high utility itemsets plays a crucial role in real-life
  applications such as market basket analysis.

<br>
<p>
In this project we focus on HUI-MINER algorithm and then we propose THUI-MINER which handles top k itemsets between driven itemsets by HUI-MINER.
After extracting these itemsets, we're going to develop a recommender system which uses the mined data from database.
